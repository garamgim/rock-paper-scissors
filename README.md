## About
I first made a Rock paper scissors Jascript console game according to the assignment 1, then after moving to the assignment 2, made a HTML & CSS Website and linked it to the previous game with refactoring. 
<br><br>
What I mainly learned in this stage is how to use DOM methods. Planning for the logic itself was not very difficult but making it work was another story. It was very exciting to apply what I learned to practice though.
